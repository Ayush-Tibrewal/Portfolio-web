      title: "The Effectiveness of Advance Deep Learning Architectures for Classification of Stress using Raw EEG Data",
      abstract:
        "Understanding and detecting stress in todayâ€™s fast-paced world remains challenging. Previous research has explored various physiological signals, including EEG (Electroencephalography), to quantify stress. However, accurately assessing stress poses a significant challenge, particularly in preprocessing and feature extraction of EEG signals. Hence, this paper employs advanced deep learning algorithms, including ResNet18-1D, DenseNet-1D, and VGG16-1D, on raw EEG signals for automated stress classification..",

      title: "Enhancing Detection Accuracy of Brain Stroke Through Cropped CT Scans With CNN Architectures",
      abstract:
        "A stroke is a life-threatening condition caused by a sudden disruption in the brain's blood supply, potentially resulting in severe neurological damage or even death. Early and accurate identification of strokes is vital for prompt treatment and better health outcomes. This study utilizes advanced deep learning architectures to predict strokes and non-strokes from CT (Computed Tomography) images. Cropping techniques are employed to reduce noise and enhance image quality. Various deep learning algorithms, including EfficientNetB0, VGG16, MobileNet, and DenseNet, are explored, Notably,",
